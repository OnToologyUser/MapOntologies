# High-level Map Ontology

The purposes of the high-level map (HLM) ontology are i) to represent the generic road knowledge for the  autonomous driving functions, ii) to provide location-awareness and lane change notification via spatial reasoning, and iii) to support continuous dynamic map process.
The HLM ontology is avaiable[here](https://github.com/claireqiu/MapOntologies/blob/5d343697d71a47309044e12238046fbe18db83b8/HighLevelMapOntology.ttl).
